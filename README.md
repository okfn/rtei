# Right to Education Index (RTEI) website

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/okfn/rtei.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/okfn/rtei)

This site can be found at https://www.rtei.org and it is powered by [Wagtail](https://wagtail.io)


# Setup

* Create a Postgres User and Database (password `pass`):

        sudo -u postgres createuser -d -S -R -P -l rtei
        sudo -u postgres createdb -O rtei rtei -E utf-8

* Create a Virtualenv and clone this repo:

        mkvirtualenv rtei
        mkdir src && cd src
        git clone git@github.com:okfn/rtei.git

* Install requirements:

        cd rtei
        pip install -r requirements.txt

* Set up the database:

        python manage.py migrate

* Create a super user and run the site:

        python manage.py createsuperuser
        python manage.py runserver


# Custom Settings

RTEI requires the following values to be set as env vars:

```bash

SECRET_KEY='xxx'

# Email to receive contact requests from the form on /about/contact-us/
RTEI_CONTACT_FORM_EMAIL='contact_form@example.com'
EMAIL_HOST='xxx'
EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD='xxx'
EMAIL_HOST_USER='xxx'

# S3 Storage for docs and resources
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID='xxx'
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY='xxx'
AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME='xxx'

# Postgres DB to use (dev defaults to postgres://rtei:pass@localhost/rtei)
DATABASE_URL='postgres:...'

# ElasticSearch endpoint use for search (dev defaults to http://localhost:9200)
ELASTICSEARCH_URL='http://example.com/es'

# Google Analytics site code for production
GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_CODE='xxx'

```

# Notes for development

## Tests

Install the tests requirements:

    pip install -r test-requirements.txt

Run:

    ./manage.py test


## Contents for development

Use the staging database's dump to populate contents for development. Copy images from the staging site to mimic the blog appearance.

## Generate data

The JSON data needed to power the visualizations on the site is built using the `build_data.py` script, which parses the original Excel (xlsx) file located at `data`.

Before running the script you must install its requirements:

    cd rtei
    pip install -r data-requirements.txt

Run `./build_data.py -h` to see all the options available.

Most of the times you will want to:

1. Update `/rtei/static/data/rtei_data_{year}.xlsx` if necessary
2. Run `./build_data.py all`

The JSON data files are generated in `rtei/static/data/{year}` by default. These files are:

* `indicators.json`: Master dictionary that links every indicator code to its title (and level). Indicators are nested, eg:

    ```json
            [
                {
                    "code": "1",
                    "children": [
                        {
                            "code": "1.1",
                            "children": [
                                {

                                    ]
                                }

                        "level": 2,
                        "title": "Structure and Support"
                    }
                ]
            },

            ...

                "1.1.5b": "Not Applicable",
                ...
    ```

### Map data

The map visualizations are powered by a [TopoJSON](https://github.com/mbostock/topojson/wiki) file. This is built using two input files, `data/countries.geojson`, which is constant and does not need to be updated, and `data/scores_per_country.csv`, which needs to be updated:

    ./build_data.py -o data scores-per-country-csv

[Install](https://github.com/mbostock/topojson/wiki/Installation) the `topojson` command (use a version lower than 2.0):

    npm install topojson@1.6.27


This is the full command that needs to be done (note that the output file goes to the `rtei/static/data`):

    topojson -p -o rtei/static/data/2021/countries.topojson --stitch-poles false --id-property iso2 -e data/scores_per_country.csv data/countries.geojson


## Dump Site data

Dump a new set of site data (this is the internal data for managing the site, like pages etc, not the data powering the visualizations):

    cd rtei
    python manage.py dumpdata --natural-foreign --indent=4 -e contenttypes -e auth.Permission -e sessions -e wagtailcore.pagerevision -e auth.user > rtei/fixtures/data.json


## Deployment

The site is hosted on Heroku:

* `rtei` is the staging site, which is deployed automatically from Travis on each push to master.
* `rtei-production` is the production site, deployed manually via git remote:

	heroku git:remote -r production -a rtei-production
	git push production master

### Migrate data on Heroku

Database migrates can be run on heroku against the production settings with:

    heroku run python ./manage.py migrate --settings=rtei.settings.production

## Translations

Translations are managed on [Transifex](https://transifex.com). You will need to install the Transifex command line client:

    pip install transifex-client

If you haven't already done it, you need to create a `~/.transifexrc` file with the following contents:

    [https://www.transifex.com]
    hostname = https://www.transifex.com
    username = YOUR_USERNAME
    password = YOUR_PASSWORD
    token =

To test that it's properly configured, run the following on the repo directory:

    tx status

You should see something along these lines:

    rtei -> rtei (1 of 1)
    Translation Files:
     - en: locale/django.pot (source)
     - ar: locale/ar/LC_MESSAGES/django.po
     - es: locale/es/LC_MESSAGES/django.po
     - fr: locale/fr/LC_MESSAGES/django.po

### Uploading translations to Transifex

New strings added to the source code that need to be translated must be regularly extracted and uploaded to Transifex.

**Note**: This also includes strings in the original data! (eg Indicator titles or responses)

To do so run the following:

    # Extract translatable strings from data
    ./build_data.py translation-strings

    # Extract strings from source code into po files (also keep the master pot file)
    ./manage.py makemessages --keep-pot

    # Upload to Transifex
    tx push -s -t --skip

    #Commit new po files
    git commit -am "Update translation files with new strings"

At this point the strings are available for translation on Transifex.


### Updating translations from Transifex

Once the translators have finished workin on Transifex, update the source code translations with the following commands:

    # Pull strings from Transifex
    tx pull

    # Compile strings catalogue, ie the locale/*.mo files (You need to restart the server after this)
    ./manage compilemessages

    # Commit the changes
    git commit -am "Updated strings from Transifex"

### Rebuilding CSS

The project uses SASS. To install it run:

    sudo gem install sass

To rebuild the CSS, watching for changes in the scss files, run:

    sass rtei/static/scss/rtei.scss:rtei/static/css/rtei.css --watch
